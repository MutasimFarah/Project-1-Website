        <h2>Network Security</h2>
        <p>Network security involves implementing measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data transmitted over a network.</p>
        <p>Topics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firewalls: Firewalls are essential network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
            <li>VPNs: Virtual Private Networks establish secure connections over public networks, ensuring data confidentiality and privacy.</li>
            <li>IDS/IPS: Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion Prevention Systems detect and prevent unauthorized access and malicious activities on a network.</li>
            <li>Network Access Control: NAC solutions enforce security policies by regulating access to network resources based on user identity, device health, and compliance status.</li>
        </ul>
